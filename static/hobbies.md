When you take hobbies seriously,
You discover a new dimension of yourself through hobbies.
You go on a personal journey, living life a different way.

On the other hand, you can go on a vacation to a new spot, one day Barcelona another day Colombia, but internally these experiences won't make you feel any different. Learning a new culture expands your knowlege horizontally, but there is no vertical expansion

But there is nothing new that you have learned about yourself. no new insight or depth in this universe
