### Your Life is a Musical Masterpiece

Life is a musical.

Here and there, you will hear notes being played in the song of your life. Eventually, you will start to feel a groove in life in some way.

You then can start to create a rhythm in your life, in other words, a routine. By doing these things over and over again, you are creating music with your life.

The stream of music within you starts flowing into everything that you do. In other words, you enjoy what you do so much that it almost feels effortless.

Think of how much energy is required to sing. Think of how much energy is required in order to be a top athlete. You need much more energy than simply washing the dishes.
