By merely observing the way that others move, you can get a glimpse into how their mind works. This is because your body and mind are inseperable; without the mind, there is no body, and without the body, there is no mind. By practicing yoga, you will start to experience this truth within yourself. You will start to see that the way that you move today affects the way that you mind works today and that the way your mind works today affects the way you move. This is because practicing yoga teaches you several 'consciousness skills', such as identifying stres, letting go of resistance, and optimizing the flow of consciousness by directing flow and intensifying flow.

## Optimizing The Flow of Consciousness

### What do I Mean By "Flow of Consciousness"?

Consciousness is simply what you experience. What you experience comes in a 'stream', the stream of consciousness. When you are about to fall asleep, this stream feels slow and dull, whereas when you are at a concert, this stream feels vibrant and full. The state of your stream of consciousness is simply the flow. In other words, however you feel right now is how your consciousness is flowing. What you do greatly determines the flow of your stream of consciousness, but with yoga, you can learn to direct the flow into what you are doing as well as control the intensity of the flow.

### Yoga Flows

In yoga, the majority of classes that are taught incorporate a yoga flow, which are groups of yoga poses that transition flawlessly into one another, almost making you feel like you are water flowing through a river.

### Directing Flow

In the most classic yoga flow, you do mountain pose into back bend, back to mountain pose, to forward fold, etc. I don't want you to just do the poses, I want you to direct your conscious attention into these poses. When you do the mountain pose, move your hands up over your head, and put tension into them like they they are your swords. Bring your attention into how your entire arms feel, how your arm is completely streched, how you you can feel that there seems to be a lot going on in your arms.

#### Directing Flow in Your Life

### Intensifying Flow

### Other Sports

If Yoga teaches you all of these, think of how other sports teach you other consciousness skills.
