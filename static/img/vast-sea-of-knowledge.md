I finished reading [How to Read a Book by Mortimer J. Adler](https://ia802804.us.archive.org/19/items/howtoreadabook1972edition/How%20to%20Read%20a%20Book%20-%201972%20Edition.pdf)        (It is on page 360 of this link) this summer and this metaphor keeps on popping up everywhere in life. It does not pertain to just books, it pertains to life itself.

If you were taken to a deserted island and you were allowed 5 books to bring with you, which books would you bring? Take some time to answer this.

When taking this thought exercise metaphorically, it becomes a lot more real than you think. In a sense, we are all deserted on an island with a vast sea of knowledge around us. It is up to you consciously choose the right resources to consume to survive and thrive.

* Would you take a banana split to a deserted island? Or would you take a survival guide to the deserted island?

## Lost in the sea of knowledge, what resources would you choose to help you thrive?

There is an overwhelming amount of information that we can choose from. Evaluating which information best suites the life you want allows you to drive the life you want with clarity.

* I want to live my life in the present moment, enjoying the only moment that exists. So, I will choose to learn about meditation, mindfulness, yoga, etc. I don't want to be aimlessly wandering in the chaotic sea of society, totally lost about living life.

## There is so much knowledge to consume, but does more knowledge make us smarter?

There is a difference between merely consuming more knowledge, and generating insight from knowledge. You can go your whole life expanding horizontally, consuming the same information but from different angles, in other words, regergitation of the common folk. But this is not going to expand your character in depth.

No. I used to read a bunch of western productivity books, but they all talk about the same truth but from different angles. 

Thesis

Horizontal expansion
Vertical expansion, depth

Instead of mere consumption.
