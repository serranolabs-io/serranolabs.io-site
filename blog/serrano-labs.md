Hey everyone, welcome to Serrano Labs LLC! The following is what we live by:

_Everything that we make is poetry, full of love, and elegant in its simplicity. This is shown by interweaving beauty and practicality into all of our products. We will never lose sight of this vision, not for anything in this world, because otherwise we would lose ourselves._

That is what we stand by. What we _actually_ do is make software!

We have made a quick and fun app called [Stwory.io](https://stwory.io). Next up is a hail mary in the name of [Bookera.pub](https://bookera.pub).

We also produce motivational content on our articles page. Be sure to check it out.

I thought it would be best to keep it short and sweet.

David Serrano
