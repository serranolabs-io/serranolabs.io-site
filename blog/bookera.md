I want to create the next generational library.

> What does that look like?

> What do you mean?

Go ahead and check it out at [bookera.pub](https://bookera.pub).

Here is a roadmap!

### Now - October 1st

- The core website
- Announcement

### October 1st - January 1st

- The Ebook Creator - create ebooks
- Accounts - Create books, save them, update them, etc.

### January 1st - February 1st

- The Catalog

### February 1st

This will be an early release. I will open up the product to select users. We will experiment and play.

- The Creator should be done.
- Catalog should be done.

### March 1st

The product should be good enough to grow organically with no advertising. We need to slowly build this with feedback from users. What comes next is up to the universe.

You can buy a corn tortilla from the store that's ready to eat, but we are hand-making them here. Patience is needed to hand-make corn tortillas, where every step of the process is sought out. I cannot rush the art.
