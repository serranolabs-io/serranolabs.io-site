> Hey there ðŸ‘‹. Do you want to make a breakthrough? Do you want to be disruptive? Need to find a problem for your next hackathon? This is for you.

# The Goal

In our everyday work, we are usually stuck iterating over previous solutions. As the machine rolls, it slows down with debt (technical, emotional, procedural), causing laziness and a lack of energy. This article is meant to help you create a new machine (whether that'd be a hackathon, new idea, new process, new spirit, new anything), one that disrupts the old way of doing things, making you and others around you more effective, happy, productive, inspired, etc. We can optimize this process by creating guideposts for strategy, unbounding the spirit, and explaining the theory behind it.

## The Guideposts to Strategy

By setting up guideposts to strategy, we can create an environment that harbors optimal design. The 3 guideposts to strategy are the diagnosis, guiding Insight, and action.

### Diagnosis

Every problem needs a proper doctor's diagnosis. To get a proper diagnosis, you need to clarify the target objective.

![Clarity over target objective](/img/target-clarity.png)

Creativity is a very messy process because there can be multiple target objectives (and even subtargets), all of which can be unclear. To clarify the target objective(s), take into account the social dynamics, technical implementation, and business values. For each part of the problem, you'll recognize that the bullseye becomes clearer when constraining yourself to limitations and by answering open questions / resolving ambiguity.

:::note
I have a very open ended [example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13E0VCHXZDiTXmKuG8ft0dkzDw_sjfyH0SAWeFJUOmiE/edit?usp=sharing) of "what should I do this weekend?". Observe how there are multiple target objectives.
:::

##### Social Dynamics

Everyone has to take into account social dynamics for their respective situation. However, what every social dynamic has in common is that they require cooperation. We can optimize it through optimizing knowledge transfer and visibility.

##### Knowledge transfer

Problems can be complex and no on understands the problem as well as you do. It is crucial that you can get others to recognize the problem in order to get as much support from managers and onboarding by other engineers.

- Record your meetings. Take succint meeting notes from the meetings and derive Insight from the meeting notes.
- Standardize the way you get your point across. When writing a slack message, make sure the slack message is concise, does not have big words, and is properly sectioned.
- If you are hosting a meeting, make sure that the conversation stays on track.
- Create high level -> low level descriptions of the problem. This is important so that you can easily tell a manager the problem in a high level way. And when you need to talk to an engineer, you can explain the problem thoroughly to them.

##### Visibility

Make all of your work public! Post your meetings to your message boards after they are done. Post your meeting notes and insight. Let everyone know what you are doing via your planning tool, like JIRA.

#### Technical Implementation

Every problem that needs to be solved requires a technical implementation. It is important to be able to distill the problem in a high level way as well as low level.

#### Business Value

- What's the business value?
- How does this fit with the overall strategy?
- What's the opportunity cost?

### Guiding Insight / policy

The guiding Insight is derived from the diagnosis, and it is meant to be a high level guide for what your action should accomplish.

:::note
[In the example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13E0VCHXZDiTXmKuG8ft0dkzDw_sjfyH0SAWeFJUOmiE/edit?usp=sharing), observe how the diagnosis is big compared to the guiding insight. This is because the Insight is synethesized / derived from the diagnosis. It should be simple and yet pack a punch.
:::

### Action

Define the steps required to tackling the problem :). With the guiding insight at your hand, it should be very clear how you should tackle the problem.

## The Spirit

> _Everyone is a creation, therefore we are all creative._

The spirit is at the center of creativity. By learning how to unbound our spirit, our creativity will not only come easy, but become very enjoyable.

### Unbound the spirit

![Fountian of Creativity](/img/fountain-of-creativity.jpeg)

Your spirit is a fountain of creativity. Sometimes it does not feel like it because it is bounded by labels, limiting beliefs, and expectations.

#### From Labels

Artist, inventor, engineer, backend engineer, frontend engineer, ux designer, craftsman, engineering manager, and product manager, are labels.
By letting them define who you are, you are bounding your spirit to the confines of these labels. In other words, the labels are creating blockages in the natural flow of your spirit's fountain of creativity. But the truth is that they _can describe_ who you are and they ultimately do not define who you are. By realizing this truth, you will unbound the spirit from the labels and it will be free :D! Your spirit's fountain of creativity will flow! If your title is an engineer and you would like to engage in activities a product manager would do, do it! If your title is an engineering manager and you would like to write some code, then do it!

#### From Limiting Beliefs

- I am not smart enough
- I am incapable
- I cannot do this

A limiting belief is simply negative self-labeling. By freeing yourself from these beliefs, you will unbound the spirit from the confines of the beliefs and your fountain of creativity will flow freely! You are smart enough, you are capable! You can do this!

#### From Expectations

Creativity is an extremely enjoyable process _IF_ you free your happiness/spirit from expectations. Make fun solutions that will make people smile, make clever solutions that will intrigue your folks. Enjoy this feeling of freedom! Enjoy the process of creativity itself **without any need to product results**. This means that you do not have any expectations to produce anything. Instead, produce because you enjoy it.

#### Let the Spirit Flourish

Not only can you remove blockages from your spirit's fountain of flow to increase flow, but you can increase the rate of flow through inspiration. Surround yourself with beauty. Listen to a beautiful song. Talk to others who inspire you and have created beautiful things. Lastly, derive inspiration from yourself. Appreciate everything that you have in your life, and accept whatever you could not change. This is because everything in your life was meant to be. Although sometimes it might not seem like it, your life has been a beautiful dance this whole time. The truth is that you are going to misstep and be offbeat. Accept it. It is part of the dance of life.

###### My Inspiration To You

This is the golden rose. It has been elegantly designed over milenia of evolution.

## Theory

If you are interested in why this all works, here it is.

## Disruption vs Iteration

![Solution Optimality](/img/solution-optimality.png)

When you are iterating over a solution, you will be optimizing the solution. However, sometimes the solution will be suboptimal compared to producing a completely different and disruptive solution.

## The Theory of Strategy

Our mind imposes a mental construct of what the solution should be. However, the actual solution to the problem is found in the _nature_ of the problem. When you are providing a diagnosis to a problem, you are describing the nature of the problem. From there, you can work to generate insight and have corresponding action that best suites the nature of the problem.

## The Theory of the Spirit

> The same force that makes the universe expand exists within us.

The force that makes the universe expand is infinitely creative and our spirit is made up of this force. Look at life: it is abundant, it is plentiful. We can say that this force exists within everything and everyone. Now take a look at a a simple rock. There is infinite depth to it that our brains are incapable of comprehending. The rock is made up of an uncountable number of atoms that are arranged in an infinitely complex set of molecules, and so on. In an attempt to navigate the complexity of this world, our brains create mental constructs of everything. The problem occurs when we bound our spirit to the confines of mental constructs. That is unideal since our spirits are limitless, just like the universe.
