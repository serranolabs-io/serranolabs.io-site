To truly become one with nature, you have to confront your weaknesses head on, all of them. Doing so will allow you to become the best version of yourself. The process is truly beautiful.

This is an honest list of my weaknesses, where I'll be dividing them up into my social, technical, busines, habitual. Being humbled is honestly one of the best things that could happen to you, and you should be completely thankful for it as it is a huge opportunity to grow.

## My Weaknesses

### Social

- Insensitive - Sometimes I might make insensitive jokes or might be insensitive with what I say. Sorry if I ever am. I have a creative mind that conjours up a lot of analogies that might not be the best.

### Technical

We're going to get deep in the weeds of this one.

#### Frontend

- Can't really write production react code. I can read it and refactor it, but writing a new component from scratch with the complicated useCallback & useMemo hooks is not my strong suit and I will definitely avoid that. If shit has to get done where I have to do it, I will do it.
- Never have published an npm package

#### Backend

- I feel like I have barely touched the surface of the backend. I have never ran something bare metal. There is a lot of abstraction around protocols like HTTP that I have never even touched.
- Kubernetes is a shitshow. But tbh, I just need to roll my own server, DNS, whatever to understand it all. But there might be no need for this.
- I have never rolled my own auth - don't do it tho.

#### Tooling

- Git - get freaking better at version control.

### Business Value

To ensure that you hit the bullseye, where all of the value resides, you must:

1. Verify your idea with others before executing
2. Actively seek to disprove your take
3. Ensure that there is no other alternative

My passion & yearning to build blinds me from justifying value.

## Fully Embrace Your Weaknesses

> The following partly comes from 'The code of an extraordinary mind'

I can lose everything, my job, my career, my home, but it will never take away my passion for life. I can spend 6 weeks and all of my energy working on a PoC and be told that you don't need it, and it will never take away my passion to live. In fact, it only drives me with more fuel.

## Stay Laser Focused

Give yourself a clear direction with your life. What do you want out of it? For me, I genuinely want to see and understand the _truth_, the way that _nature_ has intended. The way that nature has intended is beautiful. With this laser focus, I can detach myself from the ego that would rather stay comfortable and not care about failing.
