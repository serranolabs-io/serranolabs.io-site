_Take your kid to a really nice restaurant, and they'll embarrass you by playing with their food._

_Go to church with a kid, and they'll figure out how to make more noise than your neighbor's dog._

So as a kid, nothing was serious, all was fun.

But now you have a choice:

| A                       | B                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| Keep everything serious | Make everything fun |

I choose B.

I make work fun.  
I make work a playground.

Stay curious,
Endless curiousity, imagination.

Although as an adult you've seen that tree, as an adult you might not look at that tree.
Stay curious like a child. Everything you see has everything about it you've never imagined before.
