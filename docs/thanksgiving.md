Happy Thanksgiving Everyone!

The greatest thing to be thankful for is the force of creation that lives within us, because with it, we can derive joy that is infinite. This force of creation manifests as living in the present moment.

The joy of living in the present comes from the mystery of how can I make this moment enjoyable? What can I do _myself_ to create my joy?

Eventually, you'll figure out that you are a being who can create joy. The very fact that you were given a life is something that you can be thankful for, making you joyful. The very fact that you can breathe is something that you can be thankful for, making you joyful. Since your breathe will be with you for as long as you are alive, you can derive joy that is unbounded from it. You can derive unbounded joy from your limitless imagination. The joy that you can derive from problem solving is limitless. The Truth is that there will always be problems in your life, so embrace them as opportunities for growth. Ask yourself, how can I turn this problem into an opportunity for growth?

## This Sounds Too Good To Be True lol

_That's romantic David... But there's are *real* problems in this world that we cannot control: world hunger, famine, issues with parents, issues with kids etc._

Please read the steps to prepare yourself in reading the list of the following feelings and examples.

1.Consider how the feeling occurs in your life.

2.Acknowledge that the feelings exist in your body.

3.Accept the feelings as what they are, feelings. There is nothing you can do right now about the fact that at this moment, this is what you feel.

- Anger because someone has a huge ego that seems unbreakable.
- Resentment because someone has a huge ego that cannot see your side.
- Dissatisfcation because what you had expected did not turn out to be what you wanted.
- Lazy because the work you are doing seems to be worth little to nothing.
- Lethargy because you could be doing something eles.
- Remorse that you forgot to write happy birthday to your old friend.
- Worry that youre not going to deliver the work that was expected.
- Doubt that your work will not mean anything.

Now, let go of those feelings! Understand that your unhappiness about being unhappy is making you unhappy. In other words, if you don't mind being unhappy, what happens to the unhappiness? In other words, the Buddha said that "pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional".

If you have just experienced relief, or a revelation, or simply distanced yourself from that emotion, creating space, what happened is that you have brought yourself from the thinking mind (the ego) into the present moment. Remember that no matter what, you are and you always will be a being who creates joy &lt;3. You are joy.

That is all you have to read. But if you want to read even more crazier shit, here you go.

## The Seduction of the Ego

Last section I described negative feelings that arise from the ego. But there are 'positive' emotions that arise from the 'ego' which are quite seductive:

- Materialism - Omg look at this new car I got!
- Ancticipation - omg! Apple is going to release the new iPhone with 23948uj98jfMP camera! I am so excited!
- The wanting form of love (in Spanish, querer instead of amar) - GOSH I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. MY LIFE WOULD NOT BE COMPLETE WITHOUT YOU!
- Fame - OMG I WANT TO BE FAMOUS!!!
- Praise - Please tell me right now that I did good work. I, I need it.
- Pleasure - I want nicotine.

These 'positive' emotions can quickly turn into their antithesis in a moment:

- Materialism - I cannot afford this car, I have to sell it. Oh, I am unhappy now.
- Ancticipation - Apple's new iPhone sucks! I am unhappy!
- The wanting form of love (in Spanish, querer instead of amar) - life sucks without you. The moment you leave, life actually sucks.
- Fame - Damn, I've tried so hard but I am still not famous. I am greatly unhappy.
- Praise - No one is praising me!??!!? My expectations for praise were not fullfilled so I am unhappy.
- Pleasure - No nicotine = no happiness

These forms of happiness are all related as they are derived from external sources of pleasure. If you distance yourself from these 'positive' emotions, you will free yourself of the ego (the thinking mind), so that you can live in the present moment. You can forever derive joy from living in the present moment rather than deriving joy from these external factors, which are out of your control.

## The Complete Death of The Ego

When your ego completely dies, you free yourself from the identification of you with everything on this planet, allowing you to be forever thankful for the gift of the present moment. Because you realize that you don't identify with anything that you have, you will feel connected with everything in this univesrse, experiencing the deep love, joy, and peace that make up everything within this universe. This state of being is ascending into 'heaven'. The Buddha refers to this process as Awakening.
