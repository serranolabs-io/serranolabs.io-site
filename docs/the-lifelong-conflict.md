Yes, this is titled the life long conflict, but this is mainly about why you should quit drinking.

## The Conflict Between Survival vs Creation

Your brain has two sets conflicting sets of wiring, survival and creation. These sets of wiring conflict in about every aspect of life.

Here is an example of how people justify their habits in respect to their age.

| Survival (young)                                                                                                                               | Creation (young)                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Go live and drink! Go out to concerts and get barely any sleep doing it. Also, eat ice cream because you're young, so your body can handle it! | You should be in the best shape of your life! Take advatnage of this and travel, experience as much as you can, etc!!! |

- If you're drinking all the time, you're destroying your health and you cannot be in the best shape of your life.
- If you're barely getting enough sleep, you're never going to be able to maximize the experience that you have on this planet.
- If you are eating ice cream because your body can handle it, then you also will not be in the best shape of your life.

| Survival (old)                                                                               | Creation (old)                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| I can be fat now because I'm out of my prime, so I can enjoy drinking and eating junk food!! | I want to live as long as possible! So it is important for me to eat healthy, to sleep well, and to exercise! |

- If you're drinking all the time, then you will die sooner, lol
- If you're eating junk food when you're old, then you will also die sooner, lol

### The Problem

99% of society says that you need to live your life in balance so you should live life both ways. But in reality, a person who lives life in both ways has an internal battle _unresolved_.

### The Solution

True balance is when you resolve this internal battle by choosing to live in the state of creativity.

True Balance

- Being able to run a mile and lift heavy weights in the same workout
- Enjoy deep conversations and small talk
- Enjoy cracking jokes in pointless conversations as well as articulating your words with precision
- Read a book at 7 pm + go out dancing at 8 pm
- Paint art at 2 pm + play soccer at 3 pm
- Enjoy a meditation session + a concert in the same day

### Why The solution is to live in the state of creativity

When you go out on a Friday night with the desire to drink, then you're going to want to drink! Theoretically,

- If you don't get your hands on the alcohol, because you have the desire to drink unfullfilled, you won't be happy that night.
- If you drink 3 beers but don't feel drunk enough AND you don't have more alcohol, your night won't be the most satisfying.

Why would you want that for yourself? To let a beverage be in control of your happiness?
Instead, if you _free_ yourself of the desire to drink, then you learn to create the happiness yourself that night. You can learn to enjoy what makes a night so fun. You can learn to embrace the friends that you have that night.

> Side note, this is the basis for meditation. This is where you learn how to enjoy your force for vitality. Because when you have lost everything else in life, you can always enjoy your breath.

When a desire to consume is unfulfilled, it will make you suffer. But you can never suffer from a desire to create, because for as long as you live, you can always create. In other words, for as long as you live, you can always breathe.

That's the ultimate joy to life, the mystery. How can I make this moment enjoyable? How can I create my happiness?

## Why is this a thing?

Your brain has evolved both systems in your brain in order for you to desire short term pleasures in times of need and long term pleasures when you have free time.

### Evolution

As early as 4000 years ago, our ancestors had to hunt animals to stay alive. They were the pray of famines, drought, and plague, which were givens in life. Your brain evolved the desires in order for you to survive.

### Why does creation require training?

If we stop working out, our muscles become thinner.
If we stop reading books, our muscles for reading become thinner.
If we stop spending time with friends, our ability to socialize becomes weaker.

Your body will only sustain the wiring that it needs to live. This extra wiring costs you energy to maintain. A highly skilled individual who has learned a lot will have wiring that expends a lot of energy. But when you no longer practice the activity, your brain removes the excess wiring, allowing your brain to expend less energy.

### Maturity is a dangerous term that keeps adults average

When adults say that their kids have not matured, it means that the kids have not reached their level of growth in life. Adults become satisfied with their level of growth, plateau, and even decline as they age. Adults, as much as everyone else, are still capable of growing and becoming a better version of themselves. If they don't they'll stay in the state of survival.

If you don't think you can take risks and change your habits to do more in life, then you're merely existing day by day in the state of survival.
