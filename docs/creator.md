WIP

What is the secret to abundance in life? What is the secret to having so much? At the very root, the answer means to become a creator. A creator comes in many different forms.

It's easy to see how these people are creators:

- Engineers create by buildiing things
- Architects create by designing buildings
- Artists create by painting beauty

But these people are also creators:

- Leaders create opportunities
- Pioneers create roadmaps into new frontiers
- Managers create time

You know what doesn't create? Consumption.

- Eating a burger
- Playing videogames
- Scrolling social media
- Drinking

These things consume you. They do not let you grow and flourish. You can only flourish if you live in the state of creativity. Create. Don't consume.
