_Every single human being is a creation; therefore we are all creative._

How is it possible to code for this long, get burnt out, but then want to do it AGAIN?! This is why. The answer is because I am playing music with the universe lol.

> David, just, just shut the f\* up. Just explain lmao

> I'm serious tho, ok ok so...

A song is just a a pattern of vibrations that vibrate at certain frequencies. At times, we resonate with some vibrations and enjoy it. One reason why is because of predictibility:
Your brain is addicted to discovering patterns, so when you start to hear a beat, you groooooooove. You start bopping your head and enjoying the song! Next, you'll start to hear a rhythm,
Once you start to hear a rhythm, you just can't help but to sing, get loose, forget about where you are, be 100% in the moment, and maybe you'll start dancing!

Replace [create] with whatever activity you are doing. For me, I usually replace it with 'coding'.

When listening to music, the beat & rhythm are already made.

But when I [create], I create the beat and the rhythm.

Everyday I [create] becomes another beat in the rhythm.

Somedays, I am offbeat: I might've barely gotten anything done or been stuck during a problem.

But chain enough beats, and then you can start to create a rhythm.

The rhythm starts becoming so enjoyable that it turns into an entire song!

At this point, I cannot stop [creating]. I am solving problems left in right in the flow state.

I accept that I will be offbeat sometimes, and I have faith that I will hear the song again.
