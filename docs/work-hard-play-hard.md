Work hard play hard is one of the worst philosophies that Western culture has indoctrinated into us. Here is the alternative that will explain why.

I want you to completely blur the lines between work & play. As in, _I want you to completely integrate work & play together so that it all becomes play_. In fact, everything in your life is apart of your [life's dance](./your-life-is-a-dance.md). This is [what living with purpose really means](./what-living-with-purpose-really-means.md). Your life is a work of art. Every single thing that you do is apart of your life's canvas.

Maybe

- Cleaning the dishes feels like it sucks
- Doing chores feel like they suck
- Work sucks

But this is apart of your life's canvas. Once you _accept_ the fact that you cannot change this part of your existence, you'll be able to open your soul to be able to enjoy it. You stop dividing things and categorizing things into things you like and things you dislike, into work & play. False, divide things into what gives you joy and what doesn't give you joy. If something doesn't give you joy, or does not make you feel like you're at peace, it is because you are not in acceptance of the situation. You are not in acceptance of the work that has to get done.

- the weekends give me joy
- Hiking gives me joy

These are things that give you joy. It's easy to like something that gives you joy. But when you like something, it implicitly means that you dislike something. So don't look at it as 'liking something'. This is because everything that you like & dislike is completely subjective based on the person. However, what gives you joy is quantitative. Quantify what gives you joy & what does not give you joy,and you will then be able to discover how you can find the joy in what does not give you joy.

Doing the dishes used to give me 0 joy. It was solely because I wasn't of acceptance of what had to be done, of the fact that this is part of my life's canvas. When I accepted it, when I started painting it into my life, I immmediately found the joy in it. I fucking love doing the dishes (80% of the time). I am still working on trying to find all the joy in it!

> Everything in life is technically an opportunity for peace, joy, or enthusiam

### The complete integration between work & play

:::note
This is the spiritual concept of duality. Duality is a mental construct created by our brain. It is real to you but it is not an absolute truth. Remove the labels of 'work' & 'play' and you'll be able to view the situation for as what it truly is: joy & peace.
