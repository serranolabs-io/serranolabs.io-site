## Before The Meditation

### Type of Meditation

This is a full body meditation that connects you with your prana, your life force, your breath. During the meditation, You might be able to feel some sort of energy "burn" (more so vibrate) within you as you connect with this type of energy inside.

### The Mind as the Sky

The goal during meditation is to have your mind become the 'clear sky of the present moment'. Thoughts, desires, and sensations, are going to arise in your mind as 'clouds'. Stay away from these distractions so that you can focus on what's happening in the present moment. The reality is that you are the sky, and you can disidentify from every cloud that comes your way. During this meditation, I want you to maintain focus on your breath as you direct your attention to where the phoenix is.

## The Phoenix Of The Soul

When you fan a fire, you give the fire the oxygen; the life that it needs to burn brighter and hotter. The same thing happens when you inhale - you give yourself oxygen, you give yourself the life that you need to burn brighter and hotter. At your heart lies the source of the fire of your soul. Feel the life that you give your heart with every inhale you take.

In every exhale, the fire blazes, just like a fire blowing with the wind. Feel how the life that you just breathed in expands within you.

This is the beginning of the phoenix of the soul.

The phoenix lies dormant inside of its egg centered at your heart, waiting to be hatched. With every consciously breath, the phoenix comes alive, wiggles around, and yearns to be hatched.

You're going to hatch the phoenix of the soul within you. To do so, think of anything in life that you love. Anything. Once you have what you love, imagine that you are cupid and what you love is a flaming arrow. Shoot your heart, light it up with what you love.

The flaming arrow sets ablaze to your heart, causing the egg to hatch and a beautiful phoenix arises. The phoenix burns bright within you, its body slowly expanding to match your entire body, giving you the power to wholeheartedly believe in what you love. The flames rise from your heart center to your throat, all the way to your brain, blessing it with a fire of desire; passion. You can logically turn what you love into reality. The wings extend from your heart all the way throughout your hands, giving you the ability to use your hands to care for what you love.

The phoenix within you rises to the sky, allowing you to see what you love with clarity. It's there! What you love is there!

The tail of the phoenix stil remains grounded to the Earth, keeping you rooted in reality. What you love is not crazy.

Feel your heart powering the phoenix with love, allowing you to live a life in harmony. Feel the power of the phoenix emanate from the flames, how they burn bright into your intentions. You are a phoenix that burns bright in the darkness of the night. No matter what is happening, the phoenix of your soul illuminates your life!

When a wolf howls in the silence of the night, the sky roars and the wolf's presence is known. The phoenix within you screeches and your entire body roars. Within the stillness of the moment, the sound of the phoenix blankets your body from head to toe. All the trillions of cells in your body feel this love.

This is the phoenix of the soul. There is actually no need for anything to happen to let it burn bright within you. In fact, you have it with you in every breath you take :).You might not feel it because you have the need for something to happen. Once you let go of the need for something to happen, you set the phoenix free. Set it free and let it soar.

Set it free & let it soar!

## Post Meditation

### Explanation

Your phoenix is your soul / spirit. Your soul is always inside of you, most modern humans are just not connected with it most of the time. We're not connected with it because of two large reasons: short-wired energy & mental blockages.

- Overstimuli from overconsuming causes you to be attached to the ego. You become addicted to 'things' and get a short-wired fix when consuming these 'things'. Detoxing yourself from these 'things' that overstimulate you charge your phoenix.

- Mental blockages cause your soul to be trapped / limited. Simply by _opening_ yourself to the possibility of anything, you free your soul.

The soul also expresses itself as a different combination of the _quality_ of the basic elements (fire, earth, water, air & aether). Expressing the soul in regards to the phoenix is how you can express the element of fire of your life.

If you could feel the flames of the phoenix move around inside of your body, you connected with the quality of air.
If you felt the flames arise outside of your body, then you actually connected with aether.

### Backstory

3 things happened that made me write this.

1. I've been asked, "how does meditation make me feel?" so many times.

2. I'm reading this book which says that the only explanation for the ethereal world is poetic. So I realized that I should stop being logical and instead express how I feel poetically.

3. I woke up at 12:30 am on a Thursday night with my mind running, with it spewing brilliant ideas about work. I felt so alive. I was half awake but I felt so alive on the inside. I teared up a little bit because of how joyful I felt. I could not fall asleep because 'the phoenix remained alive' AKA, my heart was actually burning full of passion. Despite my brain not fully functioning, I could feel my heart burn. It actually hurt a little bit because of how intensely it was burning despite the fact that I needed to sleep. It burnt so hot that it felt there waas an incinerator that was fueled by every thought I had to burn brighter and hotter. There was no other way to explain this feeling than to relate it to a phoenix, making me think of these lines.
