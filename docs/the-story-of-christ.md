### A couple of asterisks

- Firstly, this is not a religious post, this is a spiritual one.
- Secondly, I grew up as a Christian with two Christian parents.

Growing up, I have always heard the story of Christ's crucifixion - Jesus Christ was wrongfully sentenced to crucifixion, endured great suffering, and then on the third day he rose again, ascending into heaven. I never knew what it meant for our lives, until now.

## In Short

In short, this represnts the need for suffering in order to experience the death of the ego. Once the ego has died, you are finally free to live in pure joy (in heaven).

## What is your ego?

Your ego is a trap that warps your reality to be perceived negatively. It manifests as fear, doubt, anxiety, anger, grudges, sadness, hatred, dislike, uneasiness, jealousy, envy, discomfort, hubris, possessiveness, clinginess. It evolved as a survival mechanism in order to protect us.

## How to collapse your ego and ascend into heaven

I have meditated everyday since October 13th, 2024 for >20 minutes and I have been able to get closer to collapse my ego. During meditation, you set the intention to focus on your breath. What might happen is that uncomfortable sensations that you want to itch will start to appear. In order to continue focusing on the breath, the Buddha put it perfectly, "Pain is inevitable, but suffering is completely optional". Acknowledge that the uncomfortable sensation exists, allow it to exist, and then accept it. For the first time in my life, in order to _not_ itch uncomfortable sensations on my body, I _let go of the urge_ instead of _resisting the urge_ as I did in the past. The uncomfortable sensations still existed, but my desire to itch it was no more. I no longer suffered.

When you sit in silence during meditation, since it is the most unstimulating thing that you can do, your ego will start generating negative thoughts in order to stimulate you. You might feel _bored_, you might experience _doubt_ for your meditation practice, _lethargy_ and _laziness_, etc. But The Truth is that you are a lifeform who is able to generate joy from merely breathing; what exists within you is joy, peace, and love that comes from the force of creation (God). When you are able to embrace the joy that comes from within and enjoy the present moment, you 'ascend into heaven'.

## But why do we need to suffer?

We need to suffer to break free from the ego because pleasure derived from the ego entraps you. The pleasure that feeds the ego is derived from external factors:

- Ego defined 'Love' AKA wanting. Ego defined love is characterized by possessiveness and clinging.
- Excitement that comes from the anticipation of an upcoming event.
- Meeting someone famous
- Drinking
- Materialism

These pleasures can be seductive. Also, the comfort that they bring do not give us the motivation that is required to break free from the ego. After all, sitting in complete silence sounds boring, but by sitting in complete silence, you can realize that you don't need anything external in order to 'ascend into heaven'.
