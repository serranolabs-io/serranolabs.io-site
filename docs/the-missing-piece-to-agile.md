Yes, let's be agile! Let's "_Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customers competitive advantage._", as stated in [The Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/).

But there is a LIMIT to how much you can be agile. This limit is defined by this triangle.

Quality = Budget(cost) x Time x Scope.

There are situations where you literally cannot be anymore agile. _Agile_ fails to acknowledge that:

- As time goes down, ability to be agile goes down.
- As less budget is allocated, the less that the team can be agile.
- As scope increases, the harder it is for the team to be agile.

The problems in most companies is that the variables of budget and scope are fixed, and since an amazing quality is expected, the engineers are expected to work longer hours. But because engineers are working longer hours, the quality inevitably goes down, morale goes down, etc.

## The Missing Piece

How do you prevent yourself from losing the ability to be agile in the first place? Agile does not speak of this. In other words, the Agile manifesto is only reactionary, it is not proactive.

### Prevention

#### Truth

Requirements will always be in development. Therefore, features can never be fully complete before they are handed off. This is called getting requirements to the Definition of "done". Acknowledging this truth will allow teams to optimize agility.

#### Solution

To get requirements to the Definition of _done_, the solution is to resolve all ambiguity by labeling requirements with a status.

- luminary
- possible technical limitations
- unknown
- unforeseen
- gaps in understanding
- incomplete

This will allow you to carve a statue.
