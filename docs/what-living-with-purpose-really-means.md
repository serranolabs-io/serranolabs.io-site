> Hey man, "let loose!", "you need a beer!".

> You are wayyyyy to hard on yourself. Give your life some flexibility!

> You need a vacation!

> Living life with purpose is boooooooring

> Why would I ever want purpose?

I totally understand your concerns, which is why I wrote this article. I agree, most adults do not understand what living with purpose really means. So here is what it really means: living a life with purpose means that you are turning your life into **a painting**, into straight up **music**, so that life is energizing, joyful, peaceful, full of love, inspiration, and passion. This means that unhappiness caused by bordeom or a lackluster life no longer exists, meaning that life becomes so full that there is no need to drink. This means that unhappiness caused from stress no longer exists, meaning that all of the stresses that used to cause you pain, unhappiness, guilt, etc., now becomes invigorating and energizes you. In order to understand how to achieve this, you must look at your life as an art piece.

## Your Life is Work of Art

The greatest artists of this world took a look at their canvas, had a vision to paint something beautiful, and manifested that vision into reality. They articulated each and every brush stroke with purpose and conviction to achieve this.

This is your life. Your life is your canvas. You have the opportunity to paint your life into something _incredibly_ beautiful, where each and every brushstroke that you make is articulated with purpose and conviction. Paint the life that you want. Hone in your skillset so that you can paint layers ontop of layers, creating depth to your lifethat is gorgeous.

The more that you intentionally paint your life, the more that it becomes clear. The more that it becomes clear, the more that you can see the vision that you have for yourself and the more that you can turn the vision into reality. Take a step back, 5 steps back, so that you can see your life's canvas right now: bask in the beauty of everything that you have painted so far and of how much of your life is yet to be painted. Your canvas is so full of color, it is so rich in experiences, and it is also very blank! You have so much more to paint, so grab a beret and your palette to get ready to paint!

The basics: washing the dishes **as soon you're done eating**, waking up in the morning, going to work, etc., are all apart of your life's painting. They are crucial parts in order for you to paint the whole picture. Without thoroughly engaging in these basics, your paint will become dry and your strokes will become weak :(. Engage in these basics because there is an incredible amount of joy that can be found in painting them into your life. Challenge yourself to see how fast you can wash the dishes! Wake up in the morning and enjoy the peace that you get from the quiet mornings :D. Go to work cleaned up, fed, and with a smile on your face so that you can get some work done!

Pain: a broken ankle, the dirty dishes piling up, not having enough money for rent, not working to your boss's expectations, are also apart of your life's canvas. Accept that these are going to make it onto your life's canvas, as you cannot change what you cannot control! With acceptance, you are able to free the unbounded source of paint within you so that you can paint with life again: you no longer become upset over missing any opportunities because of a broken ankle, as it is something that you cannot change. Instead, you focus on what is in your control and find happiness in that. You no longer get anxiety from the dirty dishes piling up, instead, the dirty dishes becomes an opporunity to turn your life clean again. You no longer have anxiety from not having enough money for rent. Instead, you look at it as a change in life that is mean to be and you flow into the next opportunity (even if it's worse) that comes your way. You no longer worry about having to work to your boss's expectations. Instead, free from worry, your vision becomes clear: you are able to pursue a new job or are able to surpass your boss's expectations with ease.

## Purposeful Energy

The source of paint within you, the stream of music within you is your _spirit_, it is your life force, it is also your Prana. To connect with it, connect with your breath. Connecting with your breath allows you to surpass the conscious barrier and enter into your subconscious, which is where your spirit lies. The spirit holds an unbounded source of energy that is interconnected with the entirity of the universe, it is also made up of the same force that makes the universe expand, which is also the same force that gave the universe life itself. Connect with it, and you will give yourself life, life that flows into everything that you do. In other words, you will be in the flow state. Yup, you can live in the [flow state for 100% of your conscious existence](./flow.md) and the article I wrote about it explains how to maximize this.

:::warning
Keep in mind that thinking itself cannot break the conscious barrier as thinking will create ego generated desires. You cannot 'require' that your life become a painting. You cannot 'demand' that your life become a painting. To actually have your life become a painting, the truth is that your life _is_ already a painting, and you have to uncover the illusion of the ego in order to see it.

## High On Life

> I look back at what I read and think that I am high on life

As you can probably tell, It seems like I am high on life. When I was traveling home to Chicago for Christmas break by plane, I learned that my luggage did not get delivered and was still in San Jose! I waited there at the baggage carousel, patiently waiting as I saw everyone else get their bags, only to realize that my bag wasn't delivered! I had so many valuables in my bag, I was tired from the long flight, and I wanted to go home to see family. Usually this causes unhappiness, however, I am high on life because I was in **acceptance of what I cannot change**. With complete clarity as I was free from stress, I tactifully was able to navigate the process required in order to request my bag. The lady who helped me felt super sorry about me, more sorry than I felt for myself, because I did not feel sorry at all. My bag was shipped and ended up coming the next morning! This is what your life can be if you live it with purpose!!!!!

:::tip
Keep in mind that a lot of people get the notion of purpose wrong. They think that life is too hard to live with purpose. But by living your life with true purpose, which is inherently effective and optimal, it is infinitely joyful.
