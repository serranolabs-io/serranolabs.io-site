_The following is a poem about how your relationship with life could be. I hope you enjoy_

### Your Relationship With Daily Life üåÖ

Imagine a world where when you wake up,\
Instead of feeling groggy,\
Or picking up your phone first thing and rotting,\
You wake up full of life.\
You wake up with the energy of a child who is waking up for chirstmas.

Imagine a world where when you work out,\
Instead of experiencing resistence,\
Instead of moaning in regret of committing to this exercise,\
The faster that you sprint, the more that you want to sprint.\
The more tired you are, the more that you push yourself.\
The more effort that you put in, the more effort that you want to put in.

### Your Relationship With Food üç≤

Imagine a world where\
Instead of ur food consuming you, where u eat, and you can‚Äôt help but eat more, like ur hunger is never satisfied,\
You have 0 cravings for food.\
Your food is _enough_; eating food actually makes u satisfied.

Imagine a world where\
Instead of being sick of eating the same thing everyday,\
Instead of needing variety,\
You can eat the same thing every day and enjoy it.\
Because your body craves sustainability, and the food you eat nourishes a sustainable way of living.

Imagine a world where\
You don't need to diet by completely cutting out food groups, like sugar, fat, etc.\
Where you can happily eat healthy,\
Where your diet becomes your lifestyle.\
And you happily are able to say no to temptations.

### Your Relationship With Energy ‚ö°

Imagine a world where\
Instead of nervousness consuming you to the point where life is unbearable,\
Nervousness becomes a tool.\
The nervous energy gets channeled into action;\
You get yourself up, you accept what you cannot change, and you prepeare for what is in your control.\
You act with confidence.

Imagine a world where\
Instead of hating your daily life,\
Instead of hating work,\
Simply being able to breathe is enough to make you feel happy.\
And you appreciate the life that you have.

Imagine a world where\
Instead of listening to love songs and dreaming about loving someone special,\
You listen to the love songs to think about love between you and yourself.\
You go out of your way to spend time loving yourself, and you give yourself that self-care day that you've always needed.

Imagine a world where\
Instead of spending your free time dulling the brain with too much netflix or videogames,\
Your joy comes from being **sharp**,\
Because being **sharp** means that you can perceive more, and thus you are able to take in more of the beauty of life.\
Moreover, when you do decide to watch tv, or play videogames it gives you energy.

## The Truth

The truth is that this life is real ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•. It's accessible within every single one of us, and it starts when you decide you are ready.

This lifestyle means that youre going to have to go back to the way that us humans used to live before we became modern. This means that you must cut out ALL **processed**/unnatural foods.

:::note
This is a very short list of what it will look like _at the end of your journey_. It is not everything. At the beginning of your journey, slowly cut out your old self until you are powerful enough to change _at will_, to completely say no to the unnatural way of living.
