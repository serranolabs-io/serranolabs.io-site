title: Everything In Moderation is a False Notion

> Hey, as long as I drink max once a week, I'm doing good

> I drink only once a week

> I only enjoy drinking with seafood

> I have never tried THC in a drink, I wanna try it

> I can smoke once a week

> I can have a cheat day

All of the above statements are commonly justified through the philosophy that as long as you do 'everything in moderation', then you are living life to its fullest. But I'm here to say that 'everything in moderation' is one of life's greatest false notions. The truth is that _life itself can be more intoxicating than any drug you have ever taken_, making things like drinking a subpar feeling. This is not proverbial. It is real. To see it, you must unveil the mask of the ego by _opening_ yourself to this new dimension of life, and then by surrendering to this new dimension of life.

## Life is Intoxicating

I am going to explain multiple ways how your life is beautiful despite the fact that there are actually no words that are capable of defining the totality of life's beauty. When you experience the truth, life is more than just the word 'beautiful'. You will hear people who have seen the truth speak with so much passion. These people have a different aura about them.

- Life is so so so beautiful that the mere fact of being alive should be enough to give you goosebumps.
- Life is so enjoyable that you don't need alcohol in order to embrace the fact that you are alive ðŸ¥¹.
- Moreover, you are an artist, and your life is the canvas. You can paint your life into a beautiful masterpiece. You can add as many colors as you want to give your life life. [I go deeper into this analogy here.](./what-living-with-purpose-really-means.md)
- Also, your life is a dance. Everything that you have done and are doing is apart of your life's dance. Any misstep that you have simply means that you are offbeat. [I go deeper into the dance analogy here.](./your-life-is-a-dance.md)

## Constraining Yourself to 'Everyting In Moderation'

If you have never felt one of the previous feelings, or if one of the previous feelings is fleeting, it is because you are unknowingly constraining yourself to the world of the ego. The ego believes that you cannot enjoy life to its fullest unless you indulge in pleasures. This is why you are feeding yourself the excuse that 'everything in moderation' as acceptable.

Giving yourself the option of drinking over the weekend because you 'deserved' it is an illusion of living life to its fullest. In fact, the need to have this choice constrains your total enjoyment by making it finite. Whereas when you are free from the ego, your total enjoyment in life is unbounded and free! Your experience of life becomes rich and abundant.

### Freeing Yourself

To free yourself from the ego, please read the article [The Flow State](./flow.md) for a deeper explanation. To keep it short, when you are entering another Monday, when you are sober, etc., you do not enjoy these moments because you are **not in the present moment**. You have expectations that these moments should be better, stagnant stress, a thinking mind, and much more that are taking you away from the inherent beauty of life.

### The Mind

> The mind is what generates the ego.

The mind is the root issue for why you cannot enjoy life to its fullest. What I mean by this is that expectations, stress, thinking, are all the fault of your mind. All expectations are created by your mind. Stress arises due to not being able to accept an unideal situation. In other words, stress is a form of expectation. So, when you enter another Monday, remove yourself from expectations that you should be acheiving something, that you would rather enjoy talking to your friends, that you would rather enjoy a beer, that you would rather not be there, that your life should be going any other way. The truth is that you are meant to experience life this way. The universe is meant to unfold this way. Accept this truth and you will open your life up to a new dimension. You will start to feel a love for life that radiates everywhere you go and into everything you do ðŸ’—.
