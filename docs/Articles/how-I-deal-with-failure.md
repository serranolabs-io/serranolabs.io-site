## My Startup Career

I have made so many failing apps. So many horrible ones. But I keep on doing it. WHY? Because it makes me feel like a kid.

What I'm about to layout for you is an extremely effective and brilliant way to view failure such that you can keep on moving on your journey. Let me explain,

A kid finds a way to turn anything into play. Take your kid to a nice restaurant, and they’ll still embarrass you by playing with their food. I know this is true because when I was a kid, I played with my food ALL OF THE TIME! Also, When I went to church with my family, I could never sit still as I was just chirping with my brothers. Nothing was serious, all was fun. That’s how I look at it now, all of it is fun, the ups and downs the twists and turns ALL OF IT!!!

The process of:

> Dreaming >> Idea >> plan >> managing time >> executing plan >> conception. All of it is fun

- Dreaming: Being absolutely crazy and unbound by reality
- Idea: Formulate your dreams into something reasonable
- Plan: Formulate your idea into an actionable plan
- Managing time: Considering time management

Execution:
CODING

Conception:
The final product

I know I’m fantasizing over the process, but the ride is NEVER PRETTY.
I’ve had several ideas which never made it past the execution phase, and it’s hurt. It’s bummed me out. But I realized that it was because I hadn’t found my rhythm and created a song yet
