# About The Founder

> I am an artist and my life is the canvas, I am here to paint a masterpiece

The greatest artists of this world took a look at their canvas, had a vision to paint something beautiful, and manifested that vision into reality. They articulated each and every brush stroke with purpose and conviction to achieve this.

In late 2021, someone poured gasoline onto the fire of my soul. It burnt so bright that it lit up the paintbuckets next to me, a beret, and I could finally see a paintbrush was in my hands this entire time.

I started to paint the life that I wanted.

In a glimpse, here’s what I achieved in 3 months:

| Before                                                                                         | After                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| I did not know how to cook a chicken breast                                                    | I explored international cuisine thru a framework that allowed me to optimize for learning                                       |
| I gave the fastest speech my English teacher in HS had ever heard in his 26 years of teaching. | I joined toastmasters, a speech club, and was told I had the “x factor”. I ended up giving ~15 speeches in the course of a year. |
| I was an average coder                                                                         | I came back to school and people started calling me a genius coder.                                                              |
| I was fat                                                                                      | I became f\*\*\*\*ing ripped                                                                                                     |

> Well, what did you do?

> I became one with the universe, I started to flow within the universal ri... \*

> “Just stfu David lmao. No one understands you when you say that"

## Here’s how I did it

### Dopamine Detox

I was becoming aware that all of these pleasures in life make you dull to the desires that deeply nourish and satisfy your soul. So I detoxxed my body:

- I stopped eating processed sugar. I have not ate cake/candy/oreos/anything with processed sugar in over 3 years now.
- I limited phone time.

I yearned for more. So I was drawn to the book that started it all: The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

### The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

I picked this up in September of 2021 thinking that this would be a fun read. But, I didn't start reading it until October.

The book ended up being so transformative that it encaptivated my soul - it uplifted the way in which my brain was wired. I WANTED MORE.

- I bought a lot more books
- Quit smoking weed for life January 15th 2022

And then, my legendary morning routine started.

### My legendary morning routine

I picked up up the 5 am club in December of 2021 for Christmas thinking that I would take the lessons learned in order to wake up at perhaps 8 am, maybe 7! Waking up at 5 am is CRAZY!!!

I slowly read the book. I read about 1-8 pages a night from January-April. Each and every night encaptivated me more to the point where my body started getting filled with adrenaline. I realized that waking up at 5 AM is not about waking up at 5 AM, it's about how _Carpe Dium_, that everything, EVERTHING in life matters. F\*\*\*ING EVERYTHING. The idea that the sun rose tomorrow was a gift that I was never EVER going to take for granted again. I told myself that I would swear an oath to waking up at 5 AM every at _weekday_ for the rest of my life.

But I had told my 'girlfriend' (I was just f'ing around with her) about the book in early April. She loved it so much that she read it and finished it in two weeks! I told her my plan about the summer, but she told me,

> If you want it badly enough, you would do it right now.

The gasoline had been poured onto my soul. It burnt so bright that I could see a paintbrush was in my hands this entire time. In other words, I realized that I was in the pilot seat of my life, and I could steer it into the direction that I wanted.

On April 18th, 2022, I swore an oath to wake up at 5 AM at every weekday at least for the rest of my life.

## Here’s how it felt

This was a journey of self love… every single problem became an opportunity to grow, mistakes became lessons to be learned, and I realized that I held the light that shined thru the darkness.

I had some scarring in my life, I had deep wounds. But I treated every single one of them like a splinter: it hurts to take it out. It’s extremely painful, but once it’s out, ITS LIBERATING!!!

I became very spiritual and one with the universe. I started tapping into our natural creative energy, to the point where I have optimized my life:

## Here’s my current routine

4:45 am wake up
4:45-4:52 use bathroom, water, and make bed
4:52-5:00 8 minute hiit workout
5:00-5:02 foam rolling
5:02-5:07 brush teeth and turn on treadmill
5:07-5:17 plan my day
5:17-5:23 tai chi
5:23-5:30 water plants get ready for gym
5:30-5:45 commute
5:45 gym
7 pm done
7:15 finished shower
7:30 at work and eating breakfast
7:45 breakfast is done
7:45-3:45 work
3:45-4:00 commute home
4-5 watch Spanish tv & recharge
5-6 startup

6-8 learning:
M startup
T Spanish
W Poetry
Th Social media campaign
8:00-8:30 wind down routine

All of these pleasures make you dull to the desires that deeply nourish and satisfy your soul

I believe in on the parabola of the global maxima
