# About The Founder

> I am an artist and my life is the canvas, I am here to paint a masterpiece

The greatest artists of this world took a look at their canvas, had a vision to paint something beautiful, and manifested that vision into reality. They articulated each and every brush stroke with purpose and conviction to achieve this.

In late 2021, someone poured gasoline onto the fire of my soul. It burnt so bright that it lit up the paintbuckets next to me, a beret, I could finally see a paintbrush was in my hands this entire time.

I started to paint the life I wanted.

In a glimpse, here’s what I achieved in 3 months:

| Before                                      | After                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| I did not know how to cook a chicken breast | I explored international cuisine thru a framework that allowed me to optimize for learning |
| I was horrible at giving speeches.          | I joined toastmasters, a speech club, and was told I had the “x factor”                    |
| I was an average coder                      | I came back to school and people started calling me a genius                               |
| I was fat                                   | I became fucking ripped                                                                    |

## Here’s how I did it

My legendary morning routine

- I read the 7 habits of highly effective people. Finished it late December
- Quit smoking weed for life January 15th 2022
  It was so profound to me that it totally uplifted the way in which my brain was wired

- I read the 5 am club.
- Started waking up at 5 am April 18th, 2022.
- My routine became: Wake up at 5, do a HIIT workout, meditate, plan my day, 9-5 LEARN, 5-9 relax, and repeat.

## Here’s how it felt

This was a journey of self love… every single problem became an opportunity to grow, mistakes became lessons to be learned, and I realized that I held the light that shined thru the darkness.

I had some scarring in my life, I had deep wounds. But I treated every single one of them like a splinter: it hurts to take it out. It’s extremely painful, but once it’s out, ITS LIBERATING!!!

I became very spiritual and one with the universe. I started tapping into our natural creative energy, to the point where I have optimized my life:

## Here’s my current routine

4:45 am wake up
4:45-4:52 use bathroom, water, and make bed
4:52-5:00 8 minute hiit workout
5:00-5:02 foam rolling
5:02-5:07 brush teeth and turn on treadmill
5:07-5:17 plan my day
5:17-5:23 tai chi
5:23-5:30 water plants get ready for gym
5:30-5:45 commute
5:45 gym
7 pm done
7:15 finished shower
7:30 at work and eating breakfast
7:45 breakfast is done
7:45-3:45 work
3:45-4:00 commute home
4-5 watch Spanish tv & recharge
5-6 startup

6-8 learning:
M startup
T Spanish
W Poetry
Th Social media campaign
8:00-8:30 wind down routine

All of these pleasures make you dull to the desires that deeply nourish and satisfy your soul

I believe in on the parabola of the global maxima
