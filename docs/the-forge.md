The stress sometimes makes it feel like you're being chipped away from the inside out.

The pressure becomes so intense that it starts to feel like you are suffocating.

But there is where you are fucking forged.

The stress chips you away until there is space for something new to arise.

Your heart starts scorching hot from the immense pressure to the point where you create sparks from within.

And your heart becomes a forge - it is engulfed with a pure burning passion as no longer does the stress or pressure burden you. It becomes channeled as fuel to forge your life into the art its meant to be.

What are you meant to be? What are your limits?

## The Explanation

> Pressure & stress can be channeled into passion

The ability to channel these 'negative' qualities into passion is a state of consciousness achievable by anyone. The following is a guide to help optimize your ability of handling the intensity.

### The Power of The Forge

Your forge is powered by energy that comes from you and your heart. Derive the energy from yourself and this is what it looks like.

- You seek joy in the journey, allowing you to carve joy out from the treaherous path in whereever you can find it. (It's about the journey, not the outcome)
- The realization that you are life, that you take up space is enough to know your inherent value. Breathe. Spread your arms out. No matter what happens in the end, you put the effort in and that's all you could do. (Once again, it is only about the journey, not the outcome)

Energy that comes from external sources such as sugar, phone, tv, and even achievements cannot be used to handle the intensity of pressure & stress.

- Do you think eating ice cream is going to help you handle any type of pressure? Maybe you can use it once to help you, but it is definitely not sustainable.
- What happens when you're knee deep into a project that hasn't achieved anything and you depend on acievements for your work ethic? You're going to break.

### Reclaim your Power - Dopamine Detox & Mindfulness

#### The Dopamine Detox

Detox from excessive stimuli. Remove yourself from sugar, phone, tv, overeating, or any stimuli that comes from the outside. Eventually, you will feel the energy that comes from within. At first, life will feel dull, but you will start to create joy - instead of going out to drink on a friday night, you might end up changing your routine by going on a journey of discovery. Maybe you'll call your friends and ask to take a walk by the moonlight, maybe you'll go play around with this new thing that you've been meaning to play with, or maybe you'll try out a hobby you've always wanted to try.

#### Mindfulness

Eat your breakfast without being on your phone or watching something. Eat it, _clear the mind_ and focus on the flavors. Maybe there's a flavor that exists in which you always missed?

This is an example of living in the present moment. I have written extensively about it.
