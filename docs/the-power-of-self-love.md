The secret to accomplishing goals with a high success rate is through self love. Do not ever tie your goals externally. [The External Trap](./the-power-of-self-love.md#the-external-trap) explains why tying your goals externally is almost always a trap. [The Cure](./the-power-of-self-love.md#the-cure) explains how self love is the cure.

## The External Trap

Setting materialistic goals is toxic to your livelyhood.

If your goal is to:

- Buy a fancy car
- Impress a girl
- Be famous

You will never be happy. Here's why

- Society says that you should buy an expensive car because it looks super cool. The problem is that once this car breaks, then you are not cool anymore. In 1-2 years when the car becomes obselete, you're not cool anymore. In the middle of a desert without any resources, you're not cool anymore.

- You finally accomplished that goal. The girl only likes you because you accomplished the goal. She wouldn't like you otherwise. Let's say you do win her heart by achieving a goal, but what if you don't meet your next goals? THEN SHE'LL LEAVE YOU!

- You're famous, cool. But at what cost? How is the relationship between you and your family?

There's clearly a problem with tying your goals to tangible outcomes.

### Externally Derived Motivation

There's also a problem with deriving motivation externally too.

- Famous person x runs a lot, I should run a lot too
- Famous person x says I should do this because it is beneficial

Here are the problems with those:

- Famous person X can be your inspiration for embarking on a journey. The problem is that the famous person probably doesn't even know you. What happens when you fall into the depths of hell? This famous person is not going to save you.

These goals can spark your drive, but it cannot be a source of energy. The source of energy, aka the cure, is self love.

## The Cure

Self love means that you set goals SOLELY to become the best version of yourself.

### What Self Love Means

Here is a list of what self love means, so that you can understand the cure through every facet of your life.

- Self love means that you are your own inspiration. You look up to yourself to get up from a horrible day and continue to work.

- Self love means that you idolize yourself to the point where you wouldn't give it up for anything in this world.

- Self love means realizing that your childlike dreams are still achievable, that you are free from the shackles of adulthood that keep you average.

- Self love means living in abundance. It means believing that you are capable as you desire.

- Self love means having a romance of Olympic magnitude with yourself. You don't have to be in the Olympics to believe that you're an Olympian.

- Self love means accepting that you're not perfect AND choosing growth in every situation -> Every problem is an opportunity for growth, mistakes are merely lessons to be learned, and you are the light that shines through the darkness.

- Self love means choosing your life instead of having life choose who you are -> you wake up when you want to instead of having to wake up to meet a deadline. You go to the bar because you want to instead of going in order to appease friends.

### Wield the Machete of Self Love

Once your source of inspiration becomes YOU, once you believe in YOU, and once you realize that the only thing that matters is that you agree with yourself (for an idea or belief), you can wield the machete of self love.

This machete is able to tear apart the rough terrain of the obstacles in your life, allowing you to clear the path. It is able to tear apart the fabric of the universe, so that you can create it yourself.
