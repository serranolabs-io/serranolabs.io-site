<!-- Every single moment in your life is apart of your life's dance.

When you have a routine going, youre feeling the rhythm of your life and it allows you to dance.

When it doesn't seem like your life is a dance, you have simply misstepped.

##

Sometimes you are aware of your misstep and you listen to the rhythm so that you can get yourself back on track.

Sometimes you are unaware of your misstep and you keep on dancing. To you, it was a blast. To others, they did not like it. -->

Although sometimes it might not seem like it, your life has been a beautiful dance this whole time - all of the steps that you have taken to get to this point in life, the good, the bad, the ugly, and everything else, has been apart of the dance of life.

The truth is that you are going to misstep and be offbeat. Accept it as it is part of the dance of life. Yeah, others won't appluad you for missteping. If you were competing, you won't get a high score for a misstep, but there is no other way that your dance should've played out, as yesterday is a date in time that you have already stepped away from. Let go of what you cannot change so that you can dance more!

Dance to the beat of daily life by thoroughly putting your body into whatever you're doing. Feel the rhythm that you create course through every cell in your body. You are alive and it feels so good. You don't need to achieve this or that, please her or him, or travel at least once a month to a exotic location to feel the dance of life.

No amount of money, a bigger house, or even a partner is needed for you to dance. You can dance right now! Do it, feel the rhythm that you create within you.

Sometimes you lose sense of the rhythm and you can no longer dance. Life becomes mundane or 'boring'. Everything becomes repetitive and lifeless. Maybe you want to dance so badly but you cannot find the rhythm. But the truth is that there is nothing you need to 'become' in order to start dancing. This is because you are the dance. Listen for a rhythm and a rhythm will find you‚ù§
